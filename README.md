Me and my friends built this project as assignment for Database course. We built this simple system called SIRIMA (Sistem Penerimaan Mahasiswa) to ease people when they want to apply to be college student. We built the backend with simple PHP, frontend with picnicss and SweetAlert, and PostgreSQL for the database.
